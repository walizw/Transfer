* Transfer

Transfer is a decentralized and federalized music streaming platform based on
the ActivityPub protocol.

** Running Transfer

To run transfer you will need to run the backend and the frontend (both work
separatedly, as the backend is a mere api). To run the backend first, create
a python environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  python -m venv venv
#+END_SRC

Activate the environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  source venv/bin/activate
#+END_SRC

After that install the requirements and run the backend:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pip install -r requirements
  cd backend
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py runserver
#+END_SRC

And it will be running in =localhost:8000=, now you'll have to run the frontent.
Fire up a different terminal, go to the =frontend= folder and execute:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  npm i
  npm run serve
#+END_SRC

And both your frontend and backend will be running now
